`select` is used to select columns
```{r}
select(litters_df, group, litter_number, gd0_weight)

select(litters_df, group, litter_number, gd0_weight)

select(litters_df, group, litter_number, gd0_weight:gd_of_birth) # ":" allows you to select things in between

select(litters_df, group, starts_with("pups")) # select all variables that starts with "pups"
# other options: ends_with(), contains(), see ?select

select(litters_df, -starts_with("gd")) # removes those that start with "gd"

select(litters_df, group, litter_id=litter_number) # rename variable

select(litters_df, group, litter_id=litter_number, everything()) # keep everything else

select(litters_df, gd0_weight, everything()) # give "gd0_weight" first and keep everything after
```
